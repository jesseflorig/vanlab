# Fleet 1 MQTT topic spec
MQTT topic specification for Fleet 1 layout.

### Format
The format is designed to best make use of single-level (`+`) and multi-level (`#`) wildcards:
```
ENVIRONMENT/AREA/PROPERTY
               â””/DEVICE/PROPERTY
```
In addition to `DEVICE`s, `AREA`s can have their own top-level computed `PROPERTY` values.
